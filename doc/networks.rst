Besides creating your own grids through the pandapower API, pandapower provides synthetic and Benchmark networks through the networks module.

The pandapower networks modul contains example networks, simple test networks, randomly generated networks, CIGRE test networks, IEEE case files and synthetic low voltage networks from Georg Kerber and Lindner et. al. and Dickert et. al..

You can find documentation for the individual modules here:
